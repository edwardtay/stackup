- Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: abi.encodePacked

### Explanation
- Purpose: The `claim` function allows users to claim tokens based on their position in a Merkle tree. The function verifies that the user is eligible to claim tokens and then transfers the appropriate amount of tokens to the user while also transferring a fee to the protocol treasury.
- Detailed Usage:
1. Zero Value Check: The function starts by checking if `currentMerkleRoot` is set. If it is `bytes32(0)`, the function reverts with `ZeroValueProvided()`.
2. Claim Status Check: It then checks if the tokens for the given index and account have already been claimed. If so, it reverts with `AlreadyClaimed()`.
3. Merkle Proof Verification: The function calculates a `node` by encoding the `account` and `cumulativeAmount` using `abi.encodePacked`. It verifies the calculated node against the `currentMerkleRoot` using the provided `merkleProof` via `MerkleProofUpgradeable.verify`. If the proof is invalid, it reverts with `InvalidMerkleProof()`.
4. Claimable Amount Calculation: It calculates the `claimableAmount` as the difference between the provided `cumulativeAmount` and the user's previously recorded `cumulativeAmount`.
5. Claimable Amount Check: If the `claimableAmount` is zero, the function reverts with `NoTokensToClaim()`.
6. Update Claim Information: It updates the user's `claim` information by setting the `lastClaimedIndex` and `cumulativeAmount` to the current values.
7. Token Transfer: It calculates the protocol fee and the actual amount to send to the user. It transfers the `amountToSen`d to the user using the `IERC20(token).transfer` function. If the transfer fails, it reverts with `TransferFailed()`. It then transfers the fee to the protocol treasury. If this transfer fails, it reverts with `TransferFailed()`.
8. Event Emission: Finally, it emits a `Claimed` event with the index, account, and `claimableAmount`.
- Impact:  This method ensures that the data is accurately and compactly encoded for hashing and verification. The Merkle proof verification enhances the security of the claim process by ensuring only legitimate claims are processed. By calculating the node with `abi.encodePacked`, the contract ensures that the encoding is consistent and compact, optimizing data storage and gas usage.
